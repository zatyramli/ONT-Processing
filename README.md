**ONTPro: An Oxford Nanopore Sequencing Pipeline**

Welcome to the ONTPro repository! This project is a comprehensive pipeline designed to process and analyze sequencing data generated using Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT). The pipeline is optimized for high-quality assembly and polishing of genomic sequences, incorporating multiple tools to ensure accuracy and efficiency in handling ONT data.ONTPro leverages several bioinformatics tools to assemble and polish genomic sequences. The script represents a complete pipeline: it takes raw ONT reads as input and outputs polished contigs, along with read quality statistics and depth coverage statistics.

The pipeline comprises several key processes:
Concatenation: Merges multiple FASTQ files into a single file for downstream analysis.
Assembly: Assembles the genome from ONT reads using Flye.
Polishing: Refines the assembly with Racon and Medaka to improve accuracy.
Alignment: Aligns assembled reads to generate a PAF file for further analysis.

## Installation

To set up the ONTPro pipeline, you need to have [Miniconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/miniconda/miniconda-install/) installed. The following steps will guide you through the installation process:

1. **Clone this repository to your local machine:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/zatyramli/ONTPro.git
    cd ONTPro
    ```

2. **Create the Conda environment:**

    ```bash
    conda env create -f ONTPro.yml
    ```

3. **Activate the Conda environment:**

    ```bash
    source /opt/miniconda3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh
    conda activate ONTPro
    ```


**Usage**

The pipeline can be executed using Nextflow, and the following command provides an example of how to run the pipeline:
```bash
nextflow run assembly.nf --fastq_path /path/to/fastq_files --ref_fasta /path/to/reference.fasta --medaka_model r941_min_high_g360
```

This command will concatenate FASTQ files, assemble the genome using Flye, polish the assembly with Racon and Medaka, and align the reads to reference sequences using Minimap2. The output will include all intermediate and final files generated during the process.

**6. Pipeline Overview**

The pipeline comprises several key processes:
Concatenation: Merges multiple FASTQ files into a single file for downstream analysis.
Assembly: Assembles the genome from ONT reads using Flye.
Polishing: Refines the assembly with Racon and Medaka to improve accuracy.
Alignment: Aligns reads to the assembled genome to generate a PAF file for further analysis.

**Troubleshooting**

If you encounter issues during installation or execution, please ensure that all dependencies are correctly installed and that the Conda environment is properly activated. For specific errors related to missing packages or library incompatibilities, refer to the Conda documentation or the Issues section of this repository.
