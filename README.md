**ONTPro: An Oxford Nanopore Sequencing Pipeline**

Welcome to the ONTPro repository! This project is a comprehensive pipeline designed to process and analyze sequencing data generated using Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT). The pipeline is optimized for high-quality assembly and polishing of genomic sequences, incorporating multiple tools to ensure accuracy and efficiency in handling ONT data.

**2. Introduction**
This pipeline is tailored for users who need to process and analyze large-scale ONT sequencing data, particularly in the context of microbial genomics. ONTPro leverages several bioinformatics tools, including Flye, Racon, Medaka, and Minimap2, to assemble and polish genomic sequences. This pipeline is designed to be robust, handling various input configurations and providing flexibility in specifying parameters such as the Medaka model.

**3. Features**
Automated Workflow: The pipeline automates the entire process from raw sequencing reads to polished assemblies.
Modular Design: Easily customize different stages of the pipeline, such as assembly, polishing, and alignment.
Compatibility: The pipeline is compatible with both Linux and macOS (Intel and M1 chips), and includes setup instructions for Conda environments.
User-Friendly: Simplifies the complex task of processing ONT data by providing a streamlined workflow that can be executed with minimal user intervention.

**4. Installation**
To set up the ONTPro pipeline, you need to have Miniconda installed. The following steps will guide you through the installation process:

Clone this repository to your local machine:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/ONTPro.git
cd ONTPro

Create the Conda environment:
bash
Copy code
conda env create -f environment.yml

Activate the Conda environment:
bash
Copy code
source /opt/miniconda3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh
conda activate ontpro_env
Install additional dependencies if necessary.

**5. Usage**
The pipeline can be executed using Nextflow, and the following command provides an example of how to run the pipeline:
bash
Copy code
nextflow run assembly.nf --fastq_path /path/to/fastq_files --ref_fasta /path/to/reference.fasta --medaka_model r941_min_high_g360

This command will concatenate FASTQ files, assemble the genome using Flye, polish the assembly with Racon and Medaka, and align the reads using Minimap2. The output will include all intermediate and final files generated during the process.

**6. Pipeline Overview**
The pipeline comprises several key processes:
Concatenation: Merges multiple FASTQ files into a single file for downstream analysis.
Assembly: Assembles the genome from ONT reads using Flye.
Polishing: Refines the assembly with Racon and Medaka to improve accuracy.
Alignment: Aligns reads to the assembled genome to generate a PAF file for further analysis.

**7. Configuration**
The pipeline allows customization through various parameters, which can be specified when running the Nextflow script. Users can specify the paths for input files, the Medaka model to be used, and other relevant options.

**8. Troubleshooting**
If you encounter issues during installation or execution, please ensure that all dependencies are correctly installed and that the Conda environment is properly activated. For specific errors related to missing packages or library incompatibilities, refer to the Conda documentation or the Issues section of this repository.
